# motionAmplifier

This is the implementation of motion amplifier.
Before doing that, you need to be able to read videos to images and vise versa.

Requirement:
- python3
- opencv
- ubuntu

The first thing that need to do is read video to frames,
then apply operations, any operations you like to the, to frames.
The last thing to do is construct frames into a vdeo.

- *manipulate_videos_with_opencv.ipynb* shows basic use of Opencv for videos.
- *frame2video.py* shows how to construct a video using existing frames.
- *video3frames.py* shows how to get all the frames of a video. 
- *utility.py* tools maybe used
